# E-Cart

## A Blockchain E-commerce Website

This project enables a website to carry out payments in cryptocurrency, <strong>using Smart Contracts<strong>. \
This project incorporates the following technologies: \
• Etherum Smart Contracts \
• Solidity \
• OpenZeppelin \
• Truffle \
• Front End (HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Javascript, React JS) \
• Back End (Node JS, KOA Framework, Mongo DB) 

I have used Reactjs to make the UI E-commerce website
and we have used DAI cryptocurrency for the payments.
For designing and coding the smart contracts in our application we have used
Solidity, OpenZeppelin and Truffle.
We have used DAI stable coin for carrying out transactions which is one of
the most popular stable coined and most decentralised.
One DAI is always equal to one dollar.
Firstly we have the front end where the user will be able to access the
application with a web browser.
The backend which ties and connects our smart contracts and the working of
the crypto network with the user interface.
We used MongoDB database where all the payments are stored and tracked.
And finally we have the Etherum blockchain which consists of the
PaymentProcessor smart contract and the ERC20 token contract where the
actual payments are done and validated.
